    <h2>New York City:</h2>
    <h3>Icon of American Urbanism</h3>
    <div style="margin-bottom: -40px">
    <div style="margin-top: 10px">
    <p>"Few American cities capture the imagination like New York. While perhaps best known for pushing the limits of fashion, finance, and real estate, the city's rich history envelops virtually all of American urbanism's most pressing themes: immigration, industrial transition, suburbanization, gentrification, segeregation, affordable housing, security, green urbanism, transportation, etc. This course uses New York as a case study for understanding modern American urbanism."<br><br></p>

    <p><br><br>As the Republican, Roy Moore was expected to enjoy a sweeping victory in the deeply red state of Alabama--until November 9th, when a woman came forward about sexual encounters with Moore when she was 14 and he in his 30s. This caught the nation's attention, putting the spotlight on Alabama and giving slight hope to those who wished to gain a Democratic seat in the Senate. As more women came forward with similar allegations, this hope grew into a proxy war between large campaign donors across the US.<br>
    </p>
  
    <p>Money poured in from individuals, PACs, and companies from all over the country to try to boost Doug Jones's chances of victory.
    Organizations and companies from California ended up contributing the most, but Jones also received higher donations from Alabama than Moore, perhaps giving Jones the home-state advantage. Jones received a total of $1,005,527 from his top contributors.</p>

    <p>Industry City "started in the 1890's when Irving T. Bush began to build a monumental intermodal manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Due to its prominent location, immense scale, and structure that supported a wide spectrum of business, Industry City (then known as Bush Terminal) flourished. It quickly became one of the most successful facilities of its type, employing nearly 25,000 workers per day and enabling Brooklyn to become a major international seaport.<br>
    By the 1960s, urban manufacturing had started its long decline. Most of Industry City’s major manufacturers – most notably the legendary Topps Baseball Card company – closed their doors or moved away, and Industry City suffered through a period of disinvestment and decay for 40 years.<br>
    In 2013, this all changed. A new ownership group, led by Belvedere Capital and Jamestown, began to redevelop Industry City. Over the past two years, Industry City has leased more than two million square feet of space and created over 2,000 jobs, capitalizing on the rapidly emerging innovation economy. It encompasses the full arc of physical, digital and engineered product design and development, including initial research, engineering, design, manufacturing, and production. Once again, the property fulfills its purpose as a thriving center of commerce and local employment."<br><br></p>
