    <h3>Icon of American Urbanism</h3>

    <p>"Few American cities capture the imagination like New York. While perhaps best known for pushing the limits of fashion, finance, and real estate, the city's rich history envelops virtually all of American urbanism's most pressing themes: immigration, industrial transition, suburbanization, gentrification, segeregation, affordable housing, security, green urbanism, transportation, etc. This course uses New York as a case study for understanding modern American urbanism."<br>

    <p><br><br>For this field study course, students had the option of picking a neighborhood in which they wished to study, and a relevant topic to research within this neighborhood. This course spanned roughly four weeks, with two weeks dedicated to academic research in Tacoma, followed by ten days of field study in New York City. During the time in New York, students had the opportunity to do their own field work, as well as partcipate in tours to help guide their understanding of this iconic city. Various tours were offered, such as a tour of the <a href="https://www.tenement.org/" target="_blank">Tenement Museum</a> on the Lower East Side, the <a href="https://brooklynnavyyard.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> near Clinton Hill, and the community organization <a href="https://elpuente.us/" target="_blank">El Puente</a> located in Williamsburg.
    </p>
  
    <p>Students were housed in dorms at <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/" target="_blank">Pratt Institute</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. The location of Pratt gave students easy access to subway lines, as well as a multitude of activities within walking distance. The interactive map below indicates Pratt's Location as well as the various subway lines and stops that span New York City. </p>

    <p>For my own project, I chose to study the topic of urban industrialism, and it's impacts on the community. Specifically, I was intrigued by the idea of the decline of industrialism in recent years, its replacement with commercial activity, and how this can potentially lead to gentrification.<br>
    The neighborhood I chose to study was Sunset Park, Brooklyn. It was located along the waterfront and primarily interested me because of the industrial hub that once existed there, and how the current developments to this area might change the very foundation of the neighborhood. </p>

    <p>Industry City "started in the 1890's when Irving T. Bush began to build a monumental intermodal manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Due to its prominent location, immense scale, and structure that supported a wide spectrum of business, Industry City (then known as Bush Terminal) flourished. It quickly became one of the most successful facilities of its type, employing nearly 25,000 workers per day and enabling Brooklyn to become a major international seaport.<br>
    By the 1960s, urban manufacturing had started its long decline. Most of Industry City’s major manufacturers – most notably the legendary Topps Baseball Card company – closed their doors or moved away, and Industry City suffered through a period of disinvestment and decay for 40 years.<br>
    In 2013, this all changed. A new ownership group, led by Belvedere Capital and Jamestown, began to redevelop Industry City. Over the past two years, Industry City has leased more than two million square feet of space and created over 2,000 jobs, capitalizing on the rapidly emerging innovation economy. It encompasses the full arc of physical, digital and engineered product design and development, including initial research, engineering, design, manufacturing, and production. Once again, the property fulfills its purpose as a thriving center of commerce and local employment."<br></p>

      <p>Throughout my study of Industry City and Sunset Park as a whole, I found that with major developments such as these, the landscape of the neighborhood is changing. Both in terms of activity, but also in terms of population. Once a vibrant, diverse population, Sunset Park is becoming a neighborhood that caters to young urban professionals. During my visit I found out that there was a proposed town car that would run along the waterfront to give better access to the Sunset Park, and in particular, Industry City. Is Industry City the way that Sunset Park, as well as other neighborhoods are heading? Could this potentially threaten to displace long time community members?<br><br></p>
